further work

draw 4 copies of regular objects and discard frags outside map volume, similar to terrain drawing system
apply darkener to regular view when drawing map superimposed over view. (gl clear depth but not colour. gl rect with transparency?)
show compass directions (name them! spinward?)
transition between 3sphere view and map views (folding)
info text with lines to map objects
put ALL items on map. scene graph?
    how to do binned by mesh/shader to reduce gl calls?
    note the mesh "property" added to bvhobj currently only used for map!
fxaa
stereo 3d support - integrate into eye view drawing?
selection of maps for different worlds, different landscape layers in worlds
bug : map drawing using vertex colour shader assumes have mesh colours. seems to produce garbage meshes eg teapot, gun. perhaps interpretating some other data as colour. looks ok but technically wrong.
map looks crap! what to do? 
    something special so objects at the top/bottom rendered correctly? 
    just have 2d map view?
    make map view just regular view with a different shader, god mode?
    3d lidar mode - can fly around in 3d, but only show surfaces "lit" by player! render a cubemap from player position - basically shadow mapping.
    map similar to how is (tetrahedron), but bent and aligned so "horizontal" surfaces align wih world where are. 
    if world big, local map for region around player maybe good idea. but could just do this HUD/AR overlays.
lower detail versions of objects (though perf appears OK)
