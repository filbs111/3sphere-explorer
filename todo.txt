speed on laptop
 vert shader complexity? (comment out player light?)
 switching buffers? does switching thru cubemap faces to draw duocylinder help?
 cut landscape sections and cull? gl option to draw subset of indices instead of separate meshes? for some min/max level of heightmap, and some radius of reflector, which parts can never be seen through portal?
terrain poly collision (tris)
teapot collision (aribtrary mesh line collision with surface)
player collision with terrain. 
player collision with boxes
landing (landing legs?)
landing camera. picture in picture?
*** move explosions with air (eg on duocylinder). what is best way to do this? put explosions in frame of object exploding on?
***	atmosphere shader + drag
buildings on duocylinder. seastead for sea! inspiration? virus, zeewolf, gravity force! cooling towers, landing pad
make virus/zarch style landscape/spaceship
option to fly virus ship, rocket, character (unity capsule style character), tank, boat... ? winged ship/plane?
better sea - frag shader waves? LOD mesh projected such that denser nearer player?
frag lighting?
make scale much bigger.
caves, tunnels?
nested duocylinder world. duocylinders with holes in?
gravity consistent with wave speed
faster portal rendering. single camera?
